# A11y checklist

## Text alternatives
* Add a text alternative to your images.
* If the content is video or audio, add a short description of the topic.

## Semantic markup
* Break up content with subheadings for new sections.
* Mark those headings with HTML header tags.
* Use the correct HTML for all structural elements.
* Use valid HTML everywhere else.
* Use clear labels on forms.

## Navigation
* Use `role="navigation"` for navigation
* Unplug your mouse and verify that you can use the ‘Tab’ key to navigate to every part of your website and use every function, including search boxes and forms – make sure each page has a sensible focus order.
* Make the keyboard focus visible on all elements (menu items, form fields, links, etc…).
* Use breadcrumbs to help with navigation. Show the sequence a user is following and where they are in that sequence. For example: You are here: Home > Fish > Bass; and
* Add a sitemap page to your website

## Form errors
* If a form requires input in a certain format, show and describe the required format.
* If a mandatory field is empty, highlight the field and explain what’s required.
* Build forms to be forgiving, accepting variations on the formats you prefer.
* Don’t ask for too much information, just what you need.
* Be specific. Use clear, concise instruction and form field labels.
* Highlight mistakes in forms with colours and symbols.
* Don’t clear a form if a user makes a mistake. Save the information and allow the user to edit their error and continue.
* Provide extra help by giving your contact details on all pages (the header or footer are great) and especially near forms.
* If the error is in the format of the input, the suggestion shows the correct format (for example, ‘The date must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY’).

## Other
* Give each page on your website a unique and descriptive title. Use pattern `Page name – Page description – Website name`
* Text can be resized to 200% without loss of content or function
* If you must use a pop-up, make sure that keyboard focus is on the window-closing ‘X’ icon in the corner that closes the pop-up. This means keyboard users can close the new window. When they do close it, return focus to the place on the page they were at before the pop-up appeared.
